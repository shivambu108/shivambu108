# Hey there, I'm Shivambu! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub lair. If you're here to steal my code, please leave a tip.

## About Me...
- 🎓 I'm a CSE undergrad at IIIT Dharwad. Imagine Hogwarts but instead of magic wands, we have keyboards... and even less social life.
- 🥷 I do competitive programming. I have a black belt in creating bugs, and an orange belt in fixing them.
- 🌐 Deep in the trenches of web development. My sites only crash on Tuesdays. Promise.
- 🤖 I'm into AI/ML, blockchain, Web3 . Anything that combines bleeding-edge tech with a dash of curiosity and a sprinkle of caffeine, count me in!

## Currently Learning...
- 🕸️ Building websites that are so responsive, they might just respond to your texts too.
- 🧠 Training AI/ML models to think, because why should humans have all the fun?
- 🔗 Exploring the decentralized world of blockchain. The future is decentralized, but my bugs are still centralized.

## ⚡Fun Facts...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/Schrödinger's Bro (Simultaneously macho and sensitive until observed)
-  I'm so good at procrastination that I've mastered the art of delaying the inevitable.
-  I code better with caffeine . My productivity increases by 45.18%🏏 after a cup 🏆. Empirically proven.

## Quote of the Day
_"Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else." – Eagleson’s Law_

Remember, the future isn't written in stone – it's coded in ones and zeroes. So, keep dreaming big, coding with passion, and if all else fails, turn it off and on again. 🚀
